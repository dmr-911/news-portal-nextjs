# NextJS Routing Exploration

## Description

This project is mainly about exploring all types of Next.js basic and advanced routing, including folder-based routing, slug-based routing, catch-all routes, parallel routing, intercepting routes, grouped routes, and API routes. Additionally, it covers middleware and some built-in files like `error.js`, `loading.js`, and `not-found.js`.



## Usage

To use this project, familiarize yourself with the different types of routing explored here. Each routing technique is documented and accompanied by code examples to illustrate its implementation.

Refer to the following sections for specific routing topics:

- **Folder-Based Routing**: Explore how Next.js handles routing based on the structure of the `pages` directory.
- **Slug-Based Routing**: Learn how to create dynamic routes using slugs.
- **Catch-All Routes**: Understand how to handle various routes with a single page component.
- **Parallel Routing**: Discover how to implement multiple routes that render different components.
- **Intercepting Routes**: Explore techniques for intercepting and modifying route behavior.
- **Grouped Routes**: Learn how to organize routes into groups for better manageability.
- **API Routes**: Explore Next.js API routes and their usage.

Additionally, examine the provided middleware examples and built-in files (`error.js`, `loading.js`, `not-found.js`) to understand how they enhance routing functionality.
